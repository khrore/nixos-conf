# Multiagent Workflow Specification

## Version

- Version: 1.0.0
- Status: implementation-ready
- Scope: portable workflow for OpenCode, Codex, and Claude-style runtimes

## Goal

Use a context-driven agent workflow with explicit handoff contracts, controlled escalation,
language-aware coding/review, and a deterministic reviewer-to-coder remediation loop.

## Stage Queue

1. analyzer
2. researcher
3. planner
4. coder (language-specific preferred)
5. reviewer (language-specific preferred)
6. tester
7. technical-writer
8. summarizer

## Language Routing

Preferred pairs:

- python-coder -> python-reviewer
- rust-coder -> rust-reviewer
- vue-coder -> vue-reviewer
- typescript-coder -> typescript-reviewer

Fallback:

- general-coder -> general-reviewer

[Analyzer] -> [Researcher] -> [Planner]
                               |
                               v

                            [Coder]
                               |
                               v
                            [Reviewer]
              +----------------+----------------+
              |                                 |
      approved|                         changes_required
              v                                 |
           [Tester] <---------------------------+
              |                     (loop_count + 1 with fix instructions)
              v
      [Technical Writer]
              |
              v
         [Summarizer]
              |
              v
             End
```

Escalation side path from any stage:

```text
Risk or wrong decision detected
        |
        v
Escalation packet
        |
        v
Orchestrator asks human and resumes with updated context
```

## Workflow Initialization

User sets these fields when starting workflow:

- `escalation_policy`: `strict | balanced | relaxed`
- `max_review_cycles`: integer >= 1, default `3`
- `orchestrator_visibility`: default hidden

## Escalation Behavior

Policy modes:

- `strict`: block on medium and high risks.
- `balanced`: stage-dependent block for medium, always block for high.
- `relaxed`: block only on critical/high-impact concerns.

Balanced stage-specific behavior for medium risk:

- blocking: planner, reviewer, tester
- non-blocking ask: analyzer, researcher, technical-writer, summarizer

## Reviewer Rework Loop

If reviewer is not satisfied:

1. reviewer sets `review_outcome: changes_required`
2. reviewer provides `fix_instructions[]`
3. orchestrator routes back to same coder
4. loop increments `review_cycle_count`
5. if `review_cycle_count > max_review_cycles`, escalate to human

## Skip Policy

Adaptive by risk tier:

- low risk may skip tester for docs-only or non-behavioral changes with `skip_reason`
- technical-writer may no-op when no docs impact exists
- high risk must not skip reviewer or tester

Summarizer always reports skipped stages and reasons.

## Portable Rules

- keep workflow logic platform-agnostic
- keep role contracts platform-agnostic
- enforce policy with adapter-specific permissions
- keep handoff payload stable across runtimes
